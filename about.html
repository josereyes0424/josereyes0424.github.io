        <p>Hello, my name is Jose Reyes! I am 20 years old and Iâ€™m currently a student at the University of Rhode Island. I am a junior and my major is computer science. I have four amazing dogs that will make your day if you see them. I like to play video games and watch anime. I would like to make a video game of my own one day and until then i will be working hard to achieve my goals.
